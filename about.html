        <!-- introduction --> 
        <p>My name is <strong>Kyle</strong> and I am a <em>TAS</em> teacher studying at ACU Strathfield, majoring in Textiles and minoring in Food Technology.</p>
        <p style="color: #7d02a2;"> These are my main teaching areas:</p>

        <!-- add paragraphs --> 
        <p>I have had the opportunity to teach at a variety of schools in my local area during my placements, including St Leo's Catholic College, Mercy College Chatswood, and Glenwood High School. During these experiences I have had the opportunity to teach a variety of classes in years 7-11, in subjects across TAS including Textiles Technology, Textiles and Design, Food Technology, Design and Technology, Technology Mandatory (Industrial Arts, Computing, Home Economics), alongside Engineering. </p>
        <p>Out of all my teaching areas, Textiles is my heart and soul, and has been a main form of art and expression that I have utilised in my own secondary and tertiary education, alongside in my personal time. This includes projects like; art quilts, medieval dresses, felt banners, plush toys, backpacks, and textile art.</p>
