            <h3>HSC Major project</h3>
            <p>Below are two examples of Major Projects by students studying the <strong>HSC Textiles and Design</strong> course.</p>
            <p>Student A achieved a Band 6, while Student B achieved a Band 5</p>

                </div>
            <p><strong>Student B</strong> produced a tie-dyed set of pants and a capelet, featuring embroidery and heat-transfer surface designs across the two components of the apparel piece. This project took inspiration from the ocean and it's ties to their families history and journey from overseas to Australia, while incorporating aspects of Chinese culture, reflecting their mother's side of the family.</p>
            <h3>Supporting Documentation</h3>
            <p>Students conducting HSC Textiles and Design must produce supporting documentation alongside their Textile Item, exploring their design inspiration, visual design development, the manufacturing specifications, their investigation and experimentation of a variety of techniques, alongside evaluating their design.</p>
            <h3>Powerhouse Museum - SHAPE</h3>
                <div class="sample-photo">
